# AbsurdistBot
A Twitter bot that repurposes tweets about trending topics into cute, simple, and positive tweets. The script scrapes the Google Trends website for popular search terms, and uses one of them to search Twitter for tweets with this word. The script conducts sentiment analysis on the words in the tweet to determine whether they are positive words or not. Natural language processing is then conducted on the positive words to determine how they will be used in the sentence for the tweet. The words are structured appropriately, and a positive emoji is added for an extra boost before the script posts the tweet.
